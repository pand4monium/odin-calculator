Logic
1. New Calc:
    -Waiting for Number
2. Number (1) input already
    -If input number, add number
    -If input operator, insert operator and start new number
3. Operator has been inserted
    -If input number, add on to second number
    -If input operator, change inserted operator
4. Number (2) input already
    -If input number, add on to second number
    -If input operator, carry out "=", 
        result becomes first number,
        add "operator"
